==Overview==

chessdog provides a chess board that makes it easy to enter, replay, analyse and share chess games and positions. It requires no installation but runs directly inside any modern browser without depending on any applets or plugins. It can import and export the chess standard formats FEN and PGN.

==Playing Games==

To make a move, you drag and drop the piece using the mouse. Only legal chess moves are accepted.

The moves of the current game can be navigated back and forth using the arrow buttons above the move list. You can also click on the textual representation of a specific move in order to go directly to the position after that move.


==Entering Positions==

You can enter or edit positions in the edit mode which is accessed by pressing the "Edit Game" link. In this mode, you can move all pieces on the board around at your will. In this mode you have a palette of all pieces available on the left side of board which you can drag onto the board. Pieces can be removed by dragging them off the board.

Additional options can be set using the "Position Options" window. It shows the current options for things like whose turn it is, which castlings are still allowed, or if a en passant move is possible. These options can be toggled by clicking on the corresponding items.


==Importing and Exporting of Games and Positions==

chessdog supports importing and exporting games and positions in various formats:

  * Import and Export of standard FEN (describes positions), see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation
  * Import and Export of standard PGN (describes complete games), see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pgn
  * Import and Export of positions as links
  * Linking to PGN files

The import and export dialogs can be accessed using the buttons labeled "Import" and "Export", respectively.

When you hit the import link, a big text box shows up, which is actually quite clever. You can put any format that chessdog can export into it and it will automatically detect the format and import it.

==FAQ==

===How do I play against another person or a computer?===

You can't. chessdog does not support playing chess against another person or computer. You can think of it as being a single-player chess game.
